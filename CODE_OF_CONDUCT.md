# Code of Conduct

**SatStay** operates on the principles of the free market and open participation. Here's how we conduct ourselves:

## Our Philosophy

- **Open Participation:** Everyone has the right to contribute to this project. Participation is voluntary and based on mutual benefit.
- **Market-Driven Incentives:** Contributions are encouraged by aligning them with personal, community, or economic incentives. 
- **Freedom of Choice:** Individuals choose how they engage with the project, understanding that their contributions are valued in the context of the market dynamics of open source.

## Standards

### Expected Behavior:

- Respect the intellectual property and contributions of others while recognizing that ideas and code can be freely shared and improved upon.
- Engage in constructive dialogue, understanding that disagreement can lead to better solutions without necessitating personal attacks.
- Transparency in intentions and actions, especially when it involves potential monetization or commercialization of parts of the project.

### Unacceptable Behavior:

- Any form of harassment or discrimination that would deter others from participating or benefiting from the project.
- Violating the rights of others, including but not limited to, copyright infringements or unauthorized use of personal data.

## Responsibilities

- **Project Maintainers:** Will ensure that the project remains open and accessible, moderating only to maintain the project's integrity and focus.
- **Contributors:** Are expected to uphold the spirit of open-source by contributing under the terms of the project's license, which should encourage reuse, modification, and redistribution.

## Enforcement

- Enforcement will be minimal, relying on community self-regulation. Issues can be addressed by:
  - Discussion among involved parties.
  - Forking the project if fundamental disagreements arise.
  - In extreme cases, maintainers may remove or reject contributions that clearly violate legal boundaries or the spirit of open-source.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is inspired by the ethos of open-source development and the principles of a free market for ideas and code.

By contributing to **SatStay**, you agree to these guidelines, understanding that your involvement is part of a larger ecosystem where everyone benefits from collective success.
